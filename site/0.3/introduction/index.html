<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-gearpump">What is Gearpump</h2>
<p>GearPump is a lightweight real-time big data streaming engine using Akka, it can also be used as an underlying platform for other general distributed applications, like distributed cron job, distributed log collection. </p>
<p>Gearpump is inspired by recent advances in the Akka framework and a desire to improve on existing streaming frameworks. Gearpump draws from a number of existing frameworks including MillWheel , Apache Storm , Spark Streaming , Apache Samza , Apache Tez  and Hadoop YARN  while leveraging Akka actors throughout its architecture.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/logo2.png" /></p>
<p>The name Gearpump is a reference to the engineering term "gear pump," which is a simple water pump that consists of only two gears. We use this name to indicate this engine is "super simple and powerful".</p>
<h2 id="technical-highlights-of-gearpump">Technical highlights of Gearpump</h2>
<p>Gearpump is a performant, flexible, fault-tolerant, and responsive streaming platform with a lot of nice features, its technical highlights include:</p>
<h3 id="actor-everywhere">Actor everywhere</h3>
<p>Actor model is a concurrency model proposed by Carl Hewitt at 1973. Actor is like a micro-service which is cohesive in the inside and isolated from outside actors. Actor is the cornerstone of Gearpump, it provide facilities to do message passing, error handling, liveliness monitoring. Gearpump use Actor everywhere. It use actor to implement everything entity in the cluster that can be treated as a service.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/actor_hierarchy.png" /></p>
<h3 id="exactly-once-message-processing">Exactly once Message Processing</h3>
<p>The exactly once here means, effect of a message will be calculated only once in the persisted state and computation errors in the history will not be propagated to future computations.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/exact.png" /></p>
<h3 id="topology-dag-dsl">Topology DAG DSL</h3>
<p>User can submit to Gearpump a computation DAG, which contains a list of nodes and edges, and each node can be parallelized to a set of tasks. Gearpump will then schedule and distribute different tasks in the DAG to different machines automatically. Each task will be started as an actor, which is long running micro-service. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/dag.png" /></p>
<h3 id="flow-control">Flow control</h3>
<p>Gearpump has built-in support for flow control. For all message passing between different tasks, the framework will assure the upstream tasks will not flood the downstream tasks. 
<img alt="" src="../../img/flowcontrol.png" /></p>
<h3 id="no-inherent-end-to-end-latency">No inherent end to end latency</h3>
<p>Gearpump is a message level streaming engine, which means every task in the DAG will process messages immediately upon receiving, and deliver messages to downstream immediately without waiting. Gearpump don't do batching when data sourcing.</p>
<h3 id="high-performance-message-passing">High Performance message passing</h3>
<p>By adopting the tricks of smart batching, Gearpump is extremely effective in transferring small messages. In one test of 4 machines, the whole cluster throughput can reach 11 million messages per second, with message size of 100 bytes.
<img alt="" src="../../img/dashboard.png" /></p>
<h3 id="high-availability-no-single-point-of-failure">High availability, No single point of failure</h3>
<p>Gearpump has a careful design for high availability. We have considered message loss, worker machine crash, application crash, master crash, brain-split, and make sure Gearpump can still recover when there errors happen. When there is message loss, lost message will be replayed; when there is worker machine crash or application crash, computation tasks will be rescheduled to new machines. For master high availability, several master nodes will form a Akka cluster, and CRDT (conflict free data type) is used to exchange the state, so as long as there is still a quorum, the master will stay functional. When one master node crash, other master nodes in the cluster will take over and state will be recovered. </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/ha.png" /></p>
<h3 id="dynamic-computation-dag-on-going">Dynamic Computation DAG (on-going)</h3>
<p>GearPump is working on a feature which allow user to dynamically add, remove, or replace a sub graph in runtime, without the need to restart the whole computation topology.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/dynamic.png" /></p>
<h3 id="able-to-handle-out-of-order-message">Able to handle out of order Message</h3>
<p>For window operation like moving average on a sliding window, it is important to make sure we have received all messages in that time window so that we can get an accurate result, but how to make sure that if the message may not arrive in exact timestamp order? GearPump solve this problem by tracking the low watermark of timestamp of all messages, so it knows whether we received all the messages in the time window or not.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../img/clock.png" /></p>
<h3 id="customizable-platform">Customizable platform</h3>
<p>Different applications have different requirements on performance metrics, some want higher throughput, some wants more data consistency; and different application have different resource requirement profile, some want more CPU, some want better data locality. Gearpump meets these requirements by allowing you to trade between different performance metrics and define customized resource scheduling strategy. </p>
<h3 id="built-in-dashboard-ui">Built-in Dashboard UI</h3>
<p>Gearpump has a built-in dashboard UI to manage the cluster and visualize the applications. The UI use REST call to connect with backend, so it is easy to embed the UI to other place you want. </p>
<h3 id="data-connectors-for-kafka-and-hdfs">Data connectors for Kafka and HDFS</h3>
<p>Gearpump has built-in data connectors for Kafka and HDFS. For Kafka connector, we support message replay from a specified timestamp.</p>

<h4 id="8-you-want-to-try-something-new-and-cool">8. you want to try something new and cool :)</h4>
<h2 id="relation-with-yarn">Relation with YARN</h2>
<p>Gearpump can run on top of YARN as a YARN application. The integration with YARN is tracked by issue #27(https://github.com/intel-hadoop/gearpump/issues/27). Although Gearpump have some function overlap with YARN, its function is limited compared with YARN. </p>
<h2 id="relation-with-storm-and-spark-streaming">Relation with Storm and Spark Streaming</h2>
<p>Storm and spark streaming are proven platforms, there are many production deployments. Compared with them, Gearpump is not than proven and there is no production deployment yet. However, there is no single platform that can cover every use case; Gearpump has its own +1 points in some special fields. As an instance, for IOT use cases, Gearpump may be considered convenient because the topology can be deployed to edge device with feature of location transparency.

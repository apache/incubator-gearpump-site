### Build For Scala 2.11
[![Scala 2.11 Build](img/download.jpg)](https://github.com/gearpump/gearpump/releases/download/{{ site.GEARPUMP_VERSION }}/gearpump-2.11-{{ site.GEARPUMP_VERSION }}.zip)

*Note that as we have upgraded the Akka library to 2.4.x, which has dropped the Scala 2.10 support, we do NOT provide Gearpump build for Scala 2.10 since Gearpump 0.8.0.*

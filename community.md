There are many ways to get help from the Apache Gearpump community. The mailing lists are the primary place where all Gearpump committers are present. These are the mailing lists that have been established for this project. For each list, there is a subscribe, unsubscribe and an archives link. Report bugs and submit feature requests can either be discussed on dev mailing list or on JIRA. Those interested in contributing to Gearpump should check out the [contribution guide](how-to-contribute.html) section.
